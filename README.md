# Take the gold

Welcome to Take the gold
This game is based on Zork for a class project in the degree in video game design and development of CITM Terrassa, Catalonia, Spain.

## Installation

Download the release zip, unzip it and execute the .exe file.

## Lore
You are a thief who must steal the treasure of the king in his castle.

## Instructions, how to play

You can move using:

n/s/e/w

north/east/south/west

go n/go e/go s/go w

go north/go east/go south/go west

Also you can use the commands:

look->to see the description of the room where you are

look+north/n/east/e/south/s/west/w->to see the description of the path

open/close+north/n/east/e/south/s/west/w->to open/close doors

help->to print the help menu with the commands.

quit->to quit the game

If the player tries to move in one direction and it prints again the room information where he is, means that there is a wall, this can "fix" with an if where you look if the source and destination of the exit is equal, prints "there is a wall", but I have left it to create confusion, if the player moves in one direction and information room is repeated, the player will wonder why it is happening, and if he makes a look + direction, he will know what there is there.

## Changelog
